        <h2> <strong> Ingredients </strong></h2>
        <p> 
           <ul>
               <li> Â¾ pound mostaccioli pasta </li>

               <li> 1 (15.5 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or 
                   more to taste </li>
                
                <li> 12 frozen cooked meatballs, thawed </li>
                
                <li> 1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
           </ul> 
        </p>

        <h2> <strong> Steps </strong></h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
        <ol> <strong> Step 1 </strong>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</ol>

         <ol> <strong> Step 2 </strong> 
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add mostaccioli and cook, 
         stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</ol> 

         <ol> <strong> Step 3 </strong>
         Transfer mostaccioli to a large glass baking dish. 
         The pasta should reach about halfway to the rim of the dish.
         Cover with as much spaghetti sauce as you like, 
          at least enough to almost cover the pasta. </ol> 

        <ol> <strong> Step 4 </strong>
          Place meatballs in a microwave-save dish and heat in 
        the microwave for about 3 minutes. Spread out on top of the pasta. 
        Cover entirely with mozzarella cheese. </ol> 
        
        <ol> <strong> Step 5 </strong>
         Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and 
         cheese is completely melted, 15 to 20 minutes. </ol>
        </ul>
        </p>
